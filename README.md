Python RM3100
=============

This project contains a python module for interfacing with SPI RM3100 integrated with MPU6050 from user space via the spidev linux kernel driver.

All code is MIT licensed unless explicitly stated otherwise.


Hints
-----
This project is depends on spidev library to make the SPI connection and 
you have to check the SPI connection as mentioned here before make the communication
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/spi/README.md

Usage
-----

```python

from MpuRm3100 import IMU
import time

DRDY = 27 #GPIO 27
SSN = 17 #GPIO 17
imu = IMU(SSN,DRDY)

imu.start()

while True:
    time.sleep(0.01)
    if imu.Readings !=None:
        print(imu.Readings['Yaw'])
		
```

```Connection
The MPU6050 to RPI
SDA --> SDA
SCL --> SCL
VCC --> 3.3V
GND --> GND

The RM3100 to RPI
MOSI --> MOSI
MISO --> MISO
SSN --> GPIO PIN(17 for example)
DRDY --> GPIO PIN(27 for example)
VCC --> 3.3V
GND --> GND
SCK --> SCLK

first make sure for the directions to be as shown
